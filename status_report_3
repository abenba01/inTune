With about a week remaining before we are set to finish inTune, the project is coming along relatively smoothly, with a few bumps here and there that we have been able to smooth out by working together and using our resources.

What we have accomplished:
Geolocation
Front-end framework
Music recommendations
*Client-side data persistence


*Upon revision, we have decided to replace data/screen scraping with client-side data persistence as it is more consistent with our scope and helps us improve the quality of our project.

What we still need to do:

*Playlist saving via MOngo Database

*Changed from previous plan to save text file containing playlist information to client machine

Server-side data persistence
	- Saving playlist to database with IP address
		- "Thanks for saving your playlist. Now, whenever you come back to inTune, you can listen to it."
Push notifications
	- Revisit alert: you have a saved playlist
		- "Hi! You have some saved playlists. Want to listen to them?"
