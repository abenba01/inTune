inTune: Music for your Mood 

Problem statement 
------

Why do we listen to what we listen to? Because of how we're feeling. Often times we spend countless minutes searching for a playlist, or searching through playlists to find songs, that fit your mood. We all know how frustrating it is when it’s hard to find what you really want to listen to. The issue is that there is no way to customize my music library for my mood.

How do you solve the problem?
------

Many music platforms are aimed at addressing what music you should listen to and how you listen to it. inTune goes to the root of the problem: why are you feeling the way you're feeling? Often times we don't recognize the many factors that affect our mood such as weather, location and time of day. inTune takes into account these external variables and makes you a customized mix based on your personal music preferences. inTune translates how you feel to what you listen to without explicitly having to search for a particular “mood” of music.
